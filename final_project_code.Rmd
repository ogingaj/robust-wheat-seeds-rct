### Preparation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load packages used in this session of R
library(tidyverse)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
library(ggplot2)
library(miceadds)

#knit here
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```


```{r tidy = FALSE}
#load the data

data <- read.csv("final_data_2.csv")

#get rows and column of data, and preview of the data 
dim(data)
head(data)


```


### Validity and RCT experiment design check 

a) Is attrition a concern? 
```{r tidy = FALSE}
#check for missing data 
colSums(is.na(data))
#create attrition indicator binary 
data$attrition <- ifelse(is.na(data$lnearnings), 1, 0)
#difference in attrition rates

#check attrition by covariates 
summary(lm(attrition ~ hhld_size + age_head_hhld + married + lnearnings, data = data))


```


```{r tidy = FALSE}
#

#show results of attrition 
#summary(lm(attrition ~ treatment, data = data))

#check attrition by town group
summary(lm(attrition ~ factor(town_group), data = data))

```


b) Are observables balanced across treatment and control groups?
```{r tidy = FALSE}
#
#check balance 
checkbal <- lm(treatment ~ hhld_size + age_head_hhld + married + lnearnings, data = data)
#show results
summary(checkbal)


```


c) Were there any peer effects to farmers who were not offered the climate-robust seeds?


```{r tidy = FALSE}
#peer effects based on town groups
data_non_offered <- data %>% filter(treatment == 0)
#regress and show results 
peer_effect_model <- lm(lnearnings ~ factor(town_group), data = data_non_offered)
#results
summary(peer_effect_model)
##view results with robust standard errors
coeftest(peer_effect_model, vcov = vcovHC(peer_effect_model, type = "HC1"))
```


Plotted results
```{r tidy = FALSE}
#plot the peer effects
data_non_offered %>% 
  group_by(town_group) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_earnings = mean(lnearnings, na.rm = TRUE),
    se = sd(lnearnings, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
    ci_lower = avg_earnings - 1.96 * se,
    ci_upper = avg_earnings + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  # Convert town_group to fraction
  ggplot(aes(x = case_when(
               town_group == 0 ~ 0.00,
               town_group == 1 ~ 0.25,
               town_group == 2 ~ 0.50,
               town_group == 3 ~ 0.75
             ), 
             y = avg_earnings)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), width = 0.03, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Earnings of Non-Treated Farmers by Town Treatment Intensity",
    x = "Fraction of Farmers Offered Seeds in Town",
    y = "Average Earnings (ln)"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75)) +
  theme_minimal()


```


### Treatment effects 

a) Did treatment increase use of seeds 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#unclustered
seed_mod <- lm(uses_new_seeds ~ treatment, data)
seed_mod %>% summary()

#with clustered se
seed_mod_cluster <- lm.cluster(uses_new_seeds ~ treatment, data = data, cluster = "town_id")
seed_mod_cluster %>% summary() 

#Being in the treatment group is linked to a significant 59% point increase in the likelihood of using new seeds

```
```{r}
#visualization
data.frame(group = names(coef(seed_mod_cluster)), 
           estimate = coef(seed_mod_cluster),
           se =  summary(seed_mod_cluster)[,2]) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(group == "(Intercept)", "Control", "Treatment"),
         ci_lo = estimate - 1.96 * se,
         ci_up = estimate + 1.96 * se
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(group = 1, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lo, ymax = ci_up), 
                width = 0.03, color = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Estimate",
       title= "Treatment Effects on Seed Use") +
  theme_minimal() 
```


b) Did use of seeds increase earnings 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#unclustered
seed_earning_mod <- lm(lnearnings ~ uses_new_seeds, data)
seed_earning_mod %>% summary()

#with clustered se
seed_earning_mod_clustered <- lm.cluster(lnearnings ~ uses_new_seeds, data = data, cluster = "town_id")
seed_earning_mod_clustered %>% summary()

#Using new seeds is associated with a significant 25% increase in earnings
```
```{r}
#visualizations
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(uses_new_seeds)) %>%
  mutate(uses_new_seeds = ifelse(uses_new_seeds == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  group_by(uses_new_seeds) %>%
  summarise(mean_lnearnings = mean(lnearnings, na.rm = T),
            sd_lnearnings = sd(lnearnings, na.rm = T),
            n = n()) %>%
  mutate(se = sd_lnearnings/sqrt(n),
         ci_lo = mean_lnearnings - 1.96 * se,
         ci_up = mean_lnearnings + 1.96 * se
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = uses_new_seeds, y = mean_lnearnings)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(group = 1, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lo, ymax = ci_up), 
                width = 0.03, color = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Uses New Seed?", y = "Average Earnings (ln)",
       title= "Earnings by New Seed Usage") 

```
