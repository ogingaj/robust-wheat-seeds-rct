### Preparation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load packages used in this session of R
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
library(fBasics)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(datasets)
library(haven)
library(xtable)
library(car)
library(statar)
library(stargazer)
library(fixest)
library(broom)

#knit here
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())


```


```{r tidy = FALSE}
#load the data

data <- read.csv("final_data_2.csv")

#get rows and column of data, and preview of the data 
dim(data)
head(data)


```


### Validity and RCT experiment design check 

a) Is attrition a concern? 
```{r tidy = FALSE}
#



```


b) Are observables balanced across treatment and control groups?
```{r tidy = FALSE}
#



```


c) Were there any peer effects to farmers who were not offered the climate-robust seeds?


```{r tidy = FALSE}
#



```


### Treatment effects 

a) Did treatment increase use of seeds 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#



```

b) Did use of seeds increase earnings 

```{r tidy = FALSE}
#



```
