# Abstract

This study evaluates the causal impact of adopting climate-robust wheat seeds on household earnings among farmers in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) across 283 towns. Farmers were randomly assigned to treatment groups where varying shares (25%, 50%, 75%) were offered access to the new seeds, while a control group received no offer. Using individual-level data on household demographics, seed adoption, and earnings, we assess the direct treatment effects, peer spillovers, and potential sources of bias such as attrition. Results show that the treatment significantly increased seed adoption, and adoption, in turn, was associated with a 25% rise in log household earnings. Notably, even untreated farmers benefited through peer effects in highertreatment towns. Despite minor imbalances in observed covariates and differential attrition by treatment intensity, the findings provide strong evidence that climaterobust seeds can deliver meaningful economic gains and highlight the importance of social dynamics in the diffusion of agricultural technology.
